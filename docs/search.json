In an open air prison, prisoners (all convicts) are given a small house to live in and they can have their families living with them, have visitors like one would in their own house with permission from the prison department. Some other open prisons have agriculture farms, gaushalas, etc as a fixed choice of vocation. Some prisons provide only lodging facilities to prisoners, some provide both lodging and employment. The open prisons are self-governed with their own elected Panchayat and Committees for maintenance works and discipline.\n\nSource: Prison Aid + Action Research\nAs per the latest report released by NCRB, there are a total of 88 Open Jails in India. 44% (39) of these are in Rajasthan and 21% (19) in Maharashtra. There is only one open jail in the state of Assam with 20 Male convicts.\nThe budget for Open Air Jails is allocated as part of Grant No. 15 in the state budget of Assam."

Access to justice in India’s criminal justice system involves hurdles at multiple levels in terms of ineffective legal provisions, counterproductive regulatory frameworks and rampant malpractice and corruption. In such a system, effective legal aid lies at heart of the Constitution’s equal justice and rule of law commitments.\n\nA broad overview of the legal aid hierarchy will exhibit that NALSA is at the top, then SLSAs, DLSAs, and finally Taluka Legal Services Committees (TLSCs). Additionally, there are SCLSC and High Court Legal Services Committee (HCLSC).\nSource: Project39A\nThe budget for Legal Aid is allocated as part of Grant No. 3 (Administration of Justice) in the state budget of Assam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo know more about the process of Budgeting for Legal Aid, refer to this discussion with Gale Andrews who works at Project 39A."
