Access to justice in India’s criminal justice system involves hurdles at multiple levels in terms of ineffective legal provisions, counterproductive regulatory frameworks and rampant malpractice and corruption. In such a system, effective legal aid lies at heart of the Constitution’s equal justice and rule of law commitments.\n\nA broad overview of the legal aid hierarchy will exhibit that NALSA is at the top, then SLSAs, DLSAs, and finally Taluka Legal Services Committees (TLSCs). Additionally, there are SCLSC and High Court Legal Services Committee (HCLSC).\nSource: Project39A\nThe budget for Legal Aid is allocated as part of Grant No. 3 (Administration of Justice) in the state budget of Assam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo know more about the process of Budgeting for Legal Aid, refer to this discussion with Gale Andrews who works at Project 39A."

    "text": "The state budget of the Government of Assam is spread across several grants. One way to assess a state’s capacity to deliver justice is by looking at the allocation of budgets under grants related to Police, Prison, and Judiciary. In Assam, these are represented by Grant No. 3 (Administration of Justice), Grant No. 14(Police), and Grant No. 15(Jails). In the budget for 2022-23, Assam allocated 6% of its total expenditure to police, which is higher than the average expenditure on police by other states (4.3%). The budget allocation for “Administration of Justice” is around 0.6% whereas for “Jails” it is only about 0.15% of the entire budget. These allocations represent the priorities of the state government. But how can citizens and civil society organizations, who work around improving access to justice, ensure that their demands are being represented within this budget?\nTo answer this question, we need to build the capacity to explore and analyze past and current budget datasets & documents. We should be able to inquire about the current state of affairs and the allocation and utilization of funds by the governments to improve access to justice. Often the technical and subject matter expertise required to deal with this information along with time and time and resource-related constraints restricts the capacity of citizens to engage with the state.\nThe objective behind building the platform - Budgets for Justice - Assam is to lessen the time it takes for people to collate, explore, analyze & visualize data related to budgets. We have curated budget datasets for the last 5 years for the three grants related to law and justice (Administration of Justice, Police, and Prisons). The data platform can be used to explore and analyze the trends and patterns of budget allocation and expenditure under these budget heads."

If the search terms entered into the search field contain no colon (“:”) JH will perform a simple search. If the search expression does contain at least one colon (“:”) JH will perform an advanced search.\n\nSimple Search\nThe search words typed by the user in the search box defines the main “query” constituting the essence of the search. The + and - characters are treated as mandatory and prohibited modifiers for terms. Text wrapped in balanced quote characters (for example, “Assam Correctional Homes”) is treated as a phrase. By default, all words or phrases specified by the user are treated as optional unless they are preceded by a + or a -.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCKAN will search for the complete word and when doing simple search wildcards are not supported.\n\n\n\nSimple search examples\n\ncensus will search for all the datasets containing the word “census” in the query fields.\ncensus +2019 will search for all the datasets contaning the word “census” and filter only those matching also “2019” as it is treated as mandatory.\ncensus -2019 will search for all the datasets containing the word “census” and will exclude “2019” from the results as it is treated as prohibited.\n\"european census\" will search for all the datasets containing the phrase “european census”.\nSearching for testing or tested will show also results containing the word “test”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Name of the dataset contains words separated by - it will consider each word independently in the search.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\nIf the query has a colon in it it will be considered a fielded search. This will allow us to use wildcards *, proximity matching ~ and general features described in Solr docs. The basic syntax is field:term.\nAdvanced Search Examples\n\ntitle:european this will look for all the datasets containing in its title the word “european”.\ntitle:europ* this will look for all the datasets containing in its title a word that starts with “europ” like “europe” and “european”.\ntitle:europe || title:africa will look for datasets containing “europe” or “africa” in its title.\ntitle: \"european census\" ~ 4 A proximity search looks for terms that are within a specific distance from one another. This example will look for datasets which title contains the words “european” and “census” within a distance of 4 words.\nauthor:powell~ CKAN supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use the “~” symbol at the end of a single-word term. In this example words like “jowell” or “pomell” will also be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField names used in advanced search may differ from Datasets Attributes, the mapping rules are defined in the schema file. You can use title to search by the dataset name and text to look in a catch-all field that includes author, license, mantainer, tags, etc.\n\n\n\nWe’re working to add more contextual examples to our documentation.
