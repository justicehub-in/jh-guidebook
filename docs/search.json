    "text": "Legally, Open Air Prisons are called Open Air Camps, Open Air Colonies, or Open Correctional Institutions as per the state’s terminology. In an open air prison, prisoners (all convicts) are given a small house to live in and they can have their families living with them, have visitors like one would in their own house with permission from the prison department. Some other open prisons have agriculture farms, gaushalas, etc as a fixed choice of vocation. Some prisons provide only lodging facilities to prisoners, some provide both lodging and employment. The open prisons are self-governed with their own elected Panchayat and Committees for maintenance works and discipline.\n\nSource: Prison Aid + Action Research\nAs per the latest report released by NCRB, there are a total of 88 Open Jails in India. 44% (39) of these are in Rajasthan and 21% (19) in Maharashtra. There is only one open jail in the state of Assam with 20 Male convicts."
